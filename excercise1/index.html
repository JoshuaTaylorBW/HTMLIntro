    <h2>Cities I've Lived In</h2>
    <p>I was born in Denver, and lived there until I was 10. I moved to Brazil for six months to visit my family. After that I came back to Denver for four more years. At fourteen I moved to Oakley, Kansas for a summer so I could work for my uncle on his farm. After, I came back to Denver.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Denver &#42;</li>
      <li>Atibaia, Sao Paulo, Brazil &#42;</li>
      <li>Oakley, Kansas &#42;</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cities I'd Like To Visit</h2>
    <p>I miss my family in Brazil and want to see them. I think about them everyday. Disney World is in Orlando and also great weather. I've got a really good friend who lives in Malibu and I miss her.</p>
